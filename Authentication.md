# Signing and Authenticating REST Requests

## Overview

There are 5 required headers to add to every request. This process is very similar to how Amazon does their authentication for their platform. For more information, look at 
[Amazonâ€™s documentation](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html)

## Required Authentication Headers

The 5 required headers are:

* <code>cdaccesskeyid</code> - provided by Choose Digital
* <code>x-cd-date</code> - time of request in one of the following formats
    * ISO8601 + timezone - yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'
    * ISO8601 - yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss
* <code>authorization</code> - HMAC-SHA1 hash of x-cd-date and your secret (Example code: [Java](https://github.com/choosedigital/api-spec/blob/master/resources/General.md#authentication-parameter))
* <code>Content-type:application/json</code>
* <code>Accept:application/json</code>

Optionally, you can also include a gzip/deflate header

* <code>Accept-Encoding:gzip,deflate,sdch</code>

### x-cd-date: Time Stamp Requirement

A valid time stamp, using ```x-cd-date``` header, is mandatory for all authenticated requests. Furthermore, the client time-stamp included with an authenticated request must be within 15 minutes of the Choose Digital system time when the request is received. If not, the request will fail with the ```validation.invalid.outofrange``` error status code. The intention of these restrictions is to limit the possibility that intercepted requests could be replayed.

The value of the ```x-cd-date``` header must be in one of the RFC 2616 formats ( http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt ).


##Authentication Parameter

For a few methods (like purchases), an ```authentication``` parameter is required. To calculate this parameter, concat the variables as noted for the method (we'll call that ```data``` for now) and do a HMAC-SHA1 hash with your secret key. Here's a Java sample:

## HMAC-SHA1 hash with Secret Key

Java example:

```java
public static String calculateRFC2104HMAC(String data, String secretKey) throws SignatureException {
    String result;
    try {
        // get an hmac_sha1 key from the raw key bytes
        SecretKeySpec signingKey = new SecretKeySpec(secretKey.getBytes(), "HmacSHA1");

        // get an hmac_sha1 Mac instance and initialize with the signing key
        Mac mac = Mac.getInstance("HmacSHA1");
        mac.init(signingKey);

        // compute the hmac on input data bytes
        byte[] rawHmac = mac.doFinal(data.getBytes());

        // base64-encode the hmac
        result = Codec.encodeBASE64(rawHmac);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        throw new SignatureException("Failed to generate HMAC : " + e.getMessage());
    }
    return result;
}
```
